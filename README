A colourful, dark colour scheme. This scheme is basically jellybeans.vim (https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim) with a few tweaks here and there. 

Designed primarily for a graphical Vim, but includes support for 256, 88, 16, and 8 color terminals. On a 16 or 8 color terminal, replace its colors with these for best results: https://raw.github.com/xironix/zarniwoop.vim/master/ansi-term-colors.txt

If you cant change your terminals colors, set g:zarniwoop_use_lowcolor_black to zero in your .vimrc to render black text as grey.

Feel free to fork at https://github.com/xironix/zarniwoop.vim GitHub will also generally have a more recent version than Vim.org.
